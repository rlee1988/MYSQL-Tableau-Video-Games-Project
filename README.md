## Data Cleaning
Effective data analysis begins with ensuring the data is clean and well-structured. In this section, we outline the steps taken to clean the dataset, removing inconsistencies, correcting errors, and ensuring the integrity of the data.

To facilitate this process, i've have provided a SQL script that performs the necessary data cleaning operations. The script is a stored procedure. By running this script, the dataset is prepared for accurate and reliable analysis.

You can access the SQL file for data cleaning [here](https://github.com/rml-lee/MYSQL-Tableau-Video-Games-Project/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20-%20Stored%20Procedure.sql).

## Data Schema
This is the current Data Schema that will be used for analysis after Data Cleaning.
